# Revision Continuity

## Overview

Revise existing Story Skills projects without losing continuity. Use this skill for targeted chapter edits, continuity audits, developmental revision, line edits, and pre-flight checks before drafting the next chapter.

## Prerequisites

A story project must already exist. Verify by checking for `story.md` in the project root, then run or inspect `story report .` when CLI access is available.

## Revision Workflow

1. Clarify the pass type unless the user already specified it:
   - **Continuity audit** - find contradictions, stale references, timeline problems, missing backlinks, or word-count drift
   - **Developmental revision** - improve structure, scene purpose, character motivation, pacing, stakes, and arc progression
   - **Reverse outline** - extract what each chapter actually does in one line per chapter, without looking at the outline or arc files, then diff that against what the plot files say it should do. Reorder, merge, split, or cut where they disagree. Read: every chapter in `chapters/`, `plot/timeline.md`, active arc files. Update: `plot/timeline.md`, arc plot-point tables, `chapters/_index.md` when chapters move, merge, or split.
   - **Theme audit** - check whether the ending engages the opening's value-question and whether the theme is dramatized through consequence rather than commentary. Verify every motif introduced early is paid off by the end. Read: `story.md` premise and themes, the opening and closing chapters, theme-tracked arcs in `plot/_index.md`. Update: `story.md` premise if the draft argues a different idea, arc `themes` tags. See the `theme-craft` skill for the deep pass.
   - **Pacing waveform** - map tension per chapter to find dead zones: chapters that neither raise nor vary the tension level. Two peaks back-to-back dilute each other; a flat middle means escalation is missing. Run `story timeline .` for POV balance and characters who vanish for long stretches. Read: the chapters, `scenes/` state-changes, arc climax points. Update: chapter or scene order, or add escalation where the map goes flat.
   - **Reveal economy** - check that every reveal is earned by planted setup and that reveals are spaced rather than dumped in clusters. Unplanted twists and reveal dumps both read as cheap. Read: `continuity/promises/`, arc foreshadowing tables, `knowledge-state` in `continuity/state.md`. Update: promise/question `status` and chapter fields, foreshadowing rows.
   - **Removability audit (darling-killing)** - find scenes whose removal would change nothing downstream: no state changes, no causality, no payoff. Wire such scenes in (give them consequence), fold them into an adjacent scene, or cut them — then record the decision so nobody re-litigates it. Read: `scenes/` state-changes, `continuity/state.md`, `continuity/promises/`. Update: scene `state-changes`, promise/question status, `plot/timeline.md`.
   - **Line edit** - improve clarity, voice, rhythm, dialogue, and sensory specificity without changing plot facts. Read `style-sheet.md` for the recorded voice, and use `story prose .` to find filter words, adverb clusters, said-bookisms, echoes, uniform rhythm, and repeated phrases worth rereading
   - **Copyedit** - distinct from proof/polish: enforce a style baseline (hyphenation, capitalization, naming, numbers) and continuity of surface detail (hair color, room layouts, name spellings). This pass is mechanical consistency, not prose quality — prose quality belongs to the line edit. Read: `style-sheet.md` (create it with the `voice-style` skill if missing), `glossary/`, character and location files. Run `story prose .` and fix every avoided spelling it reports. Update: chapters, `style-sheet.md` when a new convention is settled, `glossary/`, character files where details drifted.
   - **Fact check** - verify real-world details the chapter relies on. Read: `research/` notes whose `used-in` lists the chapter. Update: research notes and their status, and the chapter where it contradicts verified findings. See the `research` skill
   - **Proof/polish** - fix small wording, grammar, repetition, and formatting issues
2. Snapshot the draft before any multi-chapter pass (see Draft Snapshots below), so the pass can be compared and undone.
3. Read the relevant context:
   - `story.md`
   - `chapters/_index.md`
   - The target chapter(s)
   - Previous and next chapters when present
   - Relevant character, location, system, and arc files referenced by the chapter frontmatter
   - Matching scene files in `scenes/`
   - `continuity/state.md`, open questions, and promises/payoffs
   - `plot/timeline.md` and active arc files for continuity-sensitive edits
4. Create a concise revision plan:
   - What will change
   - What must stay fixed for continuity
   - Which files may need updates beyond the chapter
5. Make targeted edits directly in markdown files. Do not create project-local scripts to rewrite prose.
6. Update dependent metadata:
   - Chapter frontmatter `status` (`draft` -> `revised`, `revised` -> `final` only when appropriate)
   - Chapter `word-count` via CLI when available
   - `plot/timeline.md` if events changed
   - `scenes/` records if POV, location, participants, or state changes moved
   - `continuity/state.md`, `continuity/questions/`, or `continuity/promises/` when knowledge, object ownership, mystery state, or payoffs changed
   - Arc plot points or foreshadowing status if the revision changes setup/payoff
   - Character or location files when state, relationship, or location references changed
7. Run maintenance:

```shell
story wordcount . --write
story reindex .
story links .
story validate .
story continuity .
story doctor .
```

If `story.md` links other books through `follows` or `precedes`, also run `story series .` so the revision does not break canon shared with sequels or prequels. See the `series-continuity` skill.

`story continuity` deterministically checks death ordering (`died-in` vs later appearances), promise/question chapter ordering, unfired setups, POV/cast consistency, and `continuity/state.md` references. For intentional flashbacks, memories, or recordings of dead characters, list them under chapter or scene `mentions` instead of `characters`.

If `story` is not installed, use `bun run story --` from the Story Skills repository checkout or the bundled fallback `node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js` with the same arguments, resolving the path relative to this skill folder.

## Draft Snapshots

Take a snapshot before a revision pass that touches more than one chapter, and name it after the draft it preserves (`draft-1`, `pre-beta-edit`).

- **Git projects:** check `git status`. Ask the user before committing anything; with approval, commit the current state and tag it: `git add -A && git commit -m "Draft 1 before developmental pass" && git tag draft-1`. Never push, rewrite history, or delete tags without explicit approval.
- **Projects without git:** offer to run `git init` first. If the user declines, run `story snapshot draft-1`. It stores an immutable, hashed copy of the project files under `.story/revisions/draft-1/`, which `story` commands never scan as manuscript. Do not copy the project folder by hand; `story compare` no longer reads folder copies.

After the pass, compare with the snapshot and report the result:

```shell
story compare . --ref draft-1
story compare . --ref snapshot:draft-1
```

`story compare` lists each chapter's word change, added and removed chapters, and the share of paragraphs left unchanged, so the user can see how deep the pass went. Chapters are matched by id, so a renumbered chapter shows as removed and added. It only reads git and snapshots; it never commits, tags, or takes a snapshot.

## Continuity Audit Checklist

Run `story continuity .` first to collect the deterministic findings, then check for what the CLI cannot judge:

- Character knowledge: no one acts on information they have not learned
- Character state: injuries, emotions, alliances, location, and status carry forward
- Timeline: time of day, travel time, sequence, and cause/effect stay coherent. `story timeline .` shows dated scenes in story order and marks flashbacks; check each marked scene is meant to be one
- Plot arcs: each changed scene still advances or intentionally pauses an arc
- Foreshadowing: planted and paid-off items match arc files
- Promises/questions: durable continuity records match what the chapter now reveals or withholds
- Scene state: every chapter scene has machine-readable POV, location, participants, arcs, and state-change notes
- World rules: magic, technology, politics, and geography stay consistent with worldbuilding files
- References: chapter frontmatter lists every major character, location, and arc advanced in the prose. A chapter with no references is fine by design (a quiet two-hander advances nothing on paper) — only flag missing references, never empty ones.
- Registries: indexes, word counts, and links are current after edits

## Reporting

When the user asks for an audit rather than direct edits, return findings ordered by severity with file references and concrete fixes. When the user asks for revision, summarize the edited files, changed continuity facts, and maintenance results.
